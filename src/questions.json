The risk of repudiation can be mitigated in your agreement process by ensuring that a person’s eSignature is permanently bound to the exact contents of the record at the time of signing. In addition, the process should mitigate compliance risk by enforcing regulatory requirements and proving that compliant processes are followed throughout a transaction. Digital audit trails can include evidence of compliance, a customer’s identity, or intent. If stored in a tamper-evident package, the evidence can help prove that the resulting agreement is legal, compliant, and enforceable if challenged.",
