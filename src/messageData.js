			<b>Cautiously advancing.</b> Your answers indicate you are trailing your
			peers in your digital agreement maturity. Keep up the journey! Research
			shows that wherever you are on your path to digital transformation,
			incremental progress is critical to your success. First, consider a
			solution that integrates with modern or legacy systems and supports simple
			to complex workflows. Second, don't forget that your customers need to
			have confidence in their transactions and trust that their data is
			protected. A digital agreement process that integrates with digital ID,
			smart forms, remote online notarization, and workflow tech should also be
			on your list. Your solution should strike the right balance between ease
			of use and security. ​ Finally, consider leveraging a solution that
			combines dynamic forms with contract templates and e-signature
			capabilities. This degree of digitization creates a faster and more secure
			agreement process that will not only satisfy your customer's digital-first
			preferences, but will keep your FI competitive in our increasingly
			paperless world.

			<b>Keeping pace with your peers.</b> Like many companies, yours is making
			steady progress on the path to digital agreement readiness. You are
			leveraging systems and technologies to help automate and integrate
			workflows in some but not all areas of your business. There is opportunity
			for companies like yours to more widely adopt digital agreement systems
			and eSignature capabilities, and expand your approach to identity
			verification, to drive better business outcomes. Take stock of your
			practices to ensure you are integrating disparate systems to enable the
			digitization of agreements across the entirety of your business, and
			taking advantage of biometrics and other advanced technologies to aid in
			the digital transformation of your business.
